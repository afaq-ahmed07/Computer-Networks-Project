# Cisco Packet Tracer Network Project

## Overview

This Cisco Packet Tracer project offers a hands-on exploration of computer networking mechanisms. The simulation includes the implementation of EIGRP, DHCP, routing, RIP, OSPF, VLANs, IPsec, and more. Witness the synergy of multiple routers and interconnected networks in a comprehensive networking environment.

## Cisco Packet Tracer File

The project includes a Cisco Packet Tracer (.pkt) file that you can open and explore using Cisco Packet Tracer software.

## Key Mechanisms Explored

- **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
- **Routing Protocols**
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**
- **VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)**
- **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)**

## How to Use

1. Download and install Cisco Packet Tracer from [Cisco's official website](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).
2. Open the included `.pkt` file with Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Explore the network topology and configurations.
4. Interact with routers, networks, and protocols to understand their functioning.
